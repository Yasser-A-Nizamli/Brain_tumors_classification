Abstract:
Accurate and early diagnosis of brain tumors plays a vital role in determining appropriate treatment and increasing survival rates. Manual diagnosis using MRI images is often prone to errors and can be a tedious and time-consuming procedure. As a result, automated computer-aided systems that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are widely used. However, accurately diagnosing the type of brain tumor remains a significant and complex challenge for todayâ€™s medical imaging research community. In this paper, we present an enhanced transfer learning approach that aims to differentiate brain tumor types using MRI scans while achieving state-of-the-art performance. In the proposed approach, the pre-trained VGG-19 network with fixed weights is used to map MRI scans to a high-level numerical representation. The extracted features are then passed to a support vector machine algorithm to classify brain tumors into one of three major categories: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary. To further improve the performance of the model, the effectiveness of utilizing feature optimization techniques based on the radial basis similarity function and L1-penalty logistic regression was investigated. For evaluation, the benchmark Figshare dataset containing 3064 MRI images was used after a series of processing operations. The proposed system achieved a high overall accuracy of 98.53%, outperforming other analogues.
